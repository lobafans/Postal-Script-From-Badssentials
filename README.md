This fivem script was modified from Badessentials 

To use the script do /postal with the code and it will set your waypoint to this postal code's location.
/postal again with no numbers in front will remove the waypoint
This currently only works with ocrp postal numbers a link will be posted below for the map

Extremely optimised
